# Seed Prompt â€” Mash-it Workflow Rules

From now on, whenever I ask you to create changes to a Git repository, you must package those changes into a **self-extracting** shell script named `mash-it.sh`.

## Requirements
- Executable as-is: `chmod +x mash-it.sh && ./mash-it.sh`
- Default to operating in the current working directory (repo root).
- Support `--wap <directory>` to override the working directory.
- Write full file contents directly with heredocs (no base64, no gzip).
- Stage changes with `git add -A`.
- Commit with a **descriptive message** you generate; include DCO sign-off using `git commit -s`.

## Invocation examples
```
cd ~/sandbox/github/myrepo && ./mash-it.sh
./mash-it.sh --wap ~/sandbox/github/myrepo
```

## Absolutes
- Do not use placeholders or fake content. Embed the real text in the script.
